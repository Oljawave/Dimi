                           <p>She deserves more, a better person and simply superior to me. And I, and I just needed
                              her, she is my wings. She is my angel, who often pulled me out of the bottom of my dark
                              days. She played such an important role in driving death away from me, she opened my eyes
                              and was a guide. She pulled me onto the high road and then, and then I don’t know what to
                              do, I won’t be able to move and now, looking forward, I realize that I can move on only
                              with her, because she is my constant support and the meaning of my existence.<br>
                              <br>
                              Why? Because only this person managed to light me up after complete devastation. I don’t
                              know how God sent me there and met me with her. After panic attacks, forgetting what life
                              is, wanting only death, I lost my meaning and desire. And she returned it all, that's why
                              she is the meaning
                           </p>

                                 I realize that actions speak louder than words and a guy is judged by his actions.
                                 However, give me a chance, and I will show not just with words, but with my actions
                                 what it means to be a real man.

                           <p>I realize that you acted without malicious intent, and I do not consider you guilty of
                              what happened between us. I understand that you didn’t want to hurt me in any way. Maybe
                              it was just a game of fate, which at some point decided to make a joke on us, in part
                              about me. And although it hurts and is difficult for me to understand, I try to see this
                              as nothing more than part of our common journey.

                           <p>It scares me to think that perhaps, like the comments on the song “пару минут назад” on
                              YouTube, she felt everything about me, but was afraid to open up. This feeling of
                              uncertainty and unspoken emotions leaves me with a bitter mixture of hope and fear of
                              possible outcomes.<br>
                              <br>
                              But indeed, maybe everything is the same as with the people under the comments. It’s even
                              scary to imagine that nothing worked out, purely because of fear or because of the opinion
                              of someone else. And all the most beautiful things are here, right here, but doubt and
                              opinions simply destroyed everything
                           </p>
