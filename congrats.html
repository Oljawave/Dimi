                                            Hi. I’ve been debating for a while whether or not to write here again, and
                                            tonight during a gathering, I found my answer. Our boss said some very
                                            meaningful words, and I thought, yes, it’s worth it after all.<br>
                                            Overall, I’m doing well. The year is coming to an end, and honestly, I’m
                                            quite happy with it. I recently returned to Astana from Kuala Lumpur and
                                            realized how much I missed the city, even though it’s much colder here. Back
                                            in August, I mentioned that I was planning to move there, and it happened—I
                                            went to Malaysia to live temporarily on my own.<br>
                                            After spending enough time there, I decided to visit Indonesia—Bali, to be specific—and flew there with a friend. Honestly, Bali didn’t impress me much. Yes, it’s beautiful, but like I’ve always said, I prefer big, modern cities. After a week, I returned to Kuala Lumpur. But before that, I made a stop in Jakarta—though don’t tell my mom about that, it’s a secret, haha.<br>
                                            Before heading there, I attended a concert of my favorite singer. I had bought the ticket back in July, and to be honest, I initially got one in the middle rows. But then I thought it would be better to go all in and get VIP, which I did. I overpaid by almost 200 bucks, but the front row was absolutely worth it. Somehow, everything just lined up perfectly with my stay in Malaysia.<br>
                                            During this period of my life, I met so many people. Many were Asian, but there were also Americans, Australians, and Europeans. One person who stood out was an Australian named Mats. He was staying at the same hotel as me, and one day, we met and decided to hit the club together. This was on Bali, and it was actually my first time ever going to a club. He got drunk, and we ended up walking six kilometers back to the hotel. We sat outside and just talked. He shared his life story—turns out he’s 31 and wandering around Asia to recover from depression.<br>
                                            Somehow, we started discussing relationships and marriage, and at one point, he got curious about my personal life. I told him it wasn’t all smooth sailing, and he said something that stuck with me: “The more you care about someone, the harder it is to lose them.” I couldn’t agree more. There were many other things we talked about, but honestly, I’ve forgotten most of them by now, haha.<br>
                                            Back in KL, I was cooking and looked at what I had left: just rice and corn. Suddenly, I got this flashback to summer 2023. I could picture myself deciding to cook something for someone and bringing rice and corn to your room. Do you remember? While I was cooking the rice, you started eating the corn and liked it so much that you didn’t even realize you’d eaten half the can, and we laughed about it. Then we started making rice with corn together, and you said you’d never tried that mix before.<br>
                                            A few weeks or maybe days later, one evening, I came back from Starbucks. It was your day off, and suddenly, someone knocked on my door. I opened it, and there you were, holding a covered plate. You said you’d made something for me. When I opened it and saw rice with corn, I was speechless for a minute. Ah, such memories.<br>
                                            I often went to look at the ocean in Seminyak and saw crowds of young people everywhere. One day, I saw a couple playing and joking around, and it reminded me so much of that day at the beach with you. Something inside me stirred again. That moment, I went home, grabbed my laptop, and started writing a letter—but I decided not to send it.<br>
                                            And now I’m back home, in my beloved Astana. I visited the office and am now planning where to move next. By the way, remember I mentioned a project in Qatar? I got it and completed it. Currently, I’m working on developing the Bloooom service. As usual, I’m writing the front-end part and occasionally doing some math—differentials and probability theory. Never thought I’d need advanced math like this again.<br>
                                            Tonight was the company New Year’s party. All our lives, we rush to places where no one even knows our name, while being late to those where they’re still waiting for us.<br>
                                            Honestly, we don’t celebrate New Year’s at home for personal reasons. I haven’t celebrated it since 2009. Even now, I can never seem to get into the holiday spirit, no matter how much I want to. So, as usual, I’ll just sleep at home. But at least I finally finished watching Game of Thrones, and it was amazing.<br>
                                            Overall, this year has been fantastic for me—better than the last. I’ve learned a lot: running a business, valuing family, communicating with people, smiling more, not regretting spending big, taking risks, thinking critically, and much more. Most importantly, I realized I’ve become confident in myself. I used to misunderstand what confidence meant, but now I see it’s about a clear mind and financial independence.<br>
                                            And so, another year comes to an end. I wanted to wish you a Happy New Year, even if it’s just here. May 2025 be even better than the last, with many mountains conquered, passport stamps collected, and good health for your parents and you.<br>
                                            Happy New Year.<br>
