                <h3 style="font-size: 1.9em; margin-bottom: 15px;">Short Story )</h3>
                <p style="font-style: oblique;">Ти си като морския бриз, който изпълва платната ми и ме води към
                    безкрайни хоризонти</p>
                <div class="col-md-6">

                    <p> Here I would like to talk about how everything happened. In May, I heard from Miss Anna that she
                        was expecting one person from Bulgaria, I just listened to it and forgot. A few days later she
                        comes back and says that the Girl from Bulgaria has come, and the boss also says that she also
                        works at Starbucks. And I was like okay, I don’t care. Afterwards I saw a girl of Slovenian
                        appearance near the house. I didn't pay attention to the face and just went home. Then I came to
                        Starbucks and saw a dazzling ray of sun. At that moment I was simply full of incomprehensible
                        feelings. At that moment I realized that I fell in love for the first time. I couldn’t talk to
                        you for a long time, because I’m very cowardly (in communication). The first thing I asked you
                        about was the capital of Bulgaria, then you told me about my capital, I was shocked by your
                        knowledge. I was just happy to be in the same place with you.</p>

                    <p>I always tried to call you somewhere through someone. We went to the movies, I held the popcorn
                        at an angle to make it easier for you to eat. I don't remember what was in the movie, because I
                        was only focused on you. Afterwards I showed you the camera, you were delighted with it, and I
                        was delighted to talk to you. One day we talked about different topics and at that moment I
                        simply realized that a person with such thinking is exactly the one I need, and I simply drowned
                        in you. I fell in love so much that I went into depression, because I understood my chances, and
                        the fact that they depend only on you. Seeing my condition, Aldi went and told you everything,
                        he found out that you don’t have a boyfriend, but you have an ex, and that there is a chance. At
                        that moment, I simply gave up hope and began to slowly move. But at the same time I was very
                        nervous.</p>

                    <p>One day I picked you up at the ice cream parlor, we went and sat outside and I crushed the ice
                        cream out
                        of stress. But I was incredibly happy just to be with you. Aldiyar always helped me to be in the
                        same place with you. Every day I woke up with a smile on my face, only because of the
                        understanding that I would see you again, your crazy smile and blinding gaze. Every Wednesday I
                        got up earlier than usual just to be ready for the date. Wednesday became a very expensive day
                        in my life for me and it still is. Every date with you is something special. Especially our
                        picnic, for me it was the best day of my life. We talked about very different topics, laughed,
                        it was so fun and happy. Your dress that day, without words, you were simply more beautiful than
                        beauty itself. I don’t want to remember all these days with tears in my eyes, but with a smile
                        with you...</p>

                    <p>I felt more alive than anyone alive with you, I was open and just very happy. Later I found out
                        that it turns out that telling a girl “I love you” is very difficult, but I plucked up the
                        courage and said it in 5 different languages, because I really love. I remember the days after
                        Starbucks when we talked about very scientific topics, it was wonderful, I had never talked like
                        that to anyone before. I remember the day when I talked about the bag for coffee beans, and you
                        laughed until you dropped, and I just didn’t want to stop and kept making you laugh, at such
                        moments I fell in love even more. Every time you asked why I looked at you like that, you
                        actually knew the answer, I just drowned in your eyes and didn’t want to leave. Even after you
                        left Ocean City, I continued to look at the camera with the feeling that I would see you again,
                        although I knew that I would not. I kept looking back at the Starbucks, hoping to see you
                        shining behind me. I almost died without you in those days in the city....</p>

                    <p>I had the idea of going to the airport for a long time, before we started going out on
                        Wednesdays. We rented a car the day before departure, and the only problem was the closure of
                        the Ogis restaurant. But fate helped me and Miss Anna decided to close the restaurant at 1 pm, I
                        knew that this was a sign and we immediately left for JFK. I was afraid that I wouldn’t make it
                        in time, we drove as fast as we could and fortunately made it in time. Which I'm very happy
                        about. Sometimes it seems that I am ready to do anything for you. Although no, I don’t think so,
                        but I’m really ready for anything..</p>

                    <p>Then the most difficult thing began, this is our trip. I couldn't concentrate on anything the
                        whole trip. The guys forced me to do everything, take pictures, etc. Everything I saw reminded
                        me only of you.</p>

                    <p>If I haven’t answered you for a long time, it’s not because I’m busy, but because I’m thinking of
                        something to type so that our dialogue continues. I haven't heard your voice for 20 days. I want
                        to hear you, always and everywhere. "Уже прошло 20 дней, а мне все также плохо..."
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">I apologize if this is too dramatic. Anyways, it is what it is</p>
