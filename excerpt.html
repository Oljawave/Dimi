                              I guess I'll start with my school days. I'm in the sixth grade, and it's time to choose
                              whether to continue studying at a regular school or go to an elite school. My parents want
                              me to go to an elite school, but it's not a priority. And it so happened that I applied to
                              the Presidential Intellectual School and scored all possible points in math and logic, but
                              failed my native Kazakh language, thus not entering this school. The second on the list
                              was an elite lyceum of innovations, where I was invited, but I refused. Because at the
                              time it seemed to me that it was not good. What I'm getting at is that even if I had
                              gotten into this elite school I would have been in the same class at Mako and I would have
                              met you anyway, even without Aldiyar. <br>
                              <br>
                              In general, shooting is a very rare phenomenon in Kazakhstan. But in the spring of 2022,
                              it was me who was destined to see shooting at midnight, where nobody walks. And to go home
                              I had to go through this alley, where the shooting took place. Of course I was in fear for
                              my life, because I witnessed what happened. When they saw me, they wanted to do something,
                              but luckily I was able to get away. The man didn't die, he was shot, but the fact of
                              firearms speaks volumes. So when I got home, I calmed down almost immediately and
                              practically forgot about everything.<br>
                              <br>
                              In the morning I had to leave for Astana, because I had to be on time for my studies. I
                              took a cab from Karaganda and made it to my studies on time. There was a midterm in
                              business English. I had to present a business plan for an it startup. It was the end of
                              the first year, and I had more or less learned how to speak in front of an audience. After
                              defending the project, my teammate and I got 98 points. Joyful went to their seats, not
                              having time to discuss the details, I began to feel short of breath, and then shaking with
                              a huge pulse. Called an ambulance, they picked me up from uni, when I got to the hospital
                              they started to inject me with something, nothing helped for a long time, but still
                              managed to calm me down. They let me go home and diagnosed me with a panic attack. Going
                              home I had the most fun, it's panic attacks like Tony Stark. I was afraid of dying, really
                              scared. I was shaking all the time and my heart rate was high.
                              It just wouldn't go away. I told everyone that everything was okay, but it was far from
                              that. One day a relative asked me to bring him one thing, and said to do it by bus. The
                              thing is that Astana is a very big city, 7 times bigger than Paris. And it would take 2
                              hours to get to my uncle. And so I got on the bus, not 5 minutes later I literally jumped
                              off the bus because of the attack, because I could not control it. And so I'm on a one
                              lane road far from home, ended up walking home and calmed down. A few days later I made an
                              appointment with a psychologist, I have been to her 3 times in total, as I am not working
                              at the time it was expensive and also the 3rd time I went on my own as she said all the
                              problems are because of the father. She told me to present my father behind a chair and
                              speak up and I just got up and left. She was right, but I didn't want to admit it. No my
                              father is not a bad man, it just so happened that living in the same house I had no
                              contact with him at all and simply did not know the father's love, in any way. But I got
                              over it and it's kind of okay. After all, even he said that it's too late to fix the
                              relationship, we'll just live as before. And I totally agree with him. Then I had more
                              attacks and I called my sister to see if she knew anything. She said if you're afraid of
                              death, just accept it, because it's the truth. So I did. I ended up accepting it so much
                              that I just started to want it. <br>
                              <br>
                              At the same moment as I accepted death, my mind wormhole shut down. I could no longer
                              think as before. I couldn't see the future, not even the next day. All the time I was
                              haunted by bad thoughts like jumping, going out on the road. I really didn't understand
                              why I started thinking like that, because before I was just normal. I lived like that
                              until the summer of 2023.<br>
                              <br>
                              After Aldik suggested going to the USA, I told him it was impossible. I didn't want to and
                              didn't believe in it. So he persuaded me the whole December. One day he took me out of
                              lectures and started to say let's go to the states. I finally agreed, and it was weird
                              that my dad agreed right away and gave me the money. We applied for a visa, I got the
                              visa, I went outside and saw Aldik very happy, and I tried not to offend him and tried to
                              make myself happy. And here we are in Turkey, and then in the USA. I have absolutely no
                              fun, nothing surprises me. But I pretended that I was madly happy, but at the same moment
                              standing in Times Square I wondered why I could not be really happy. Eventually we made it
                              to Ocean City as well. Again nothing impressive. That was the mood I lived in for a
                              month.<br>
                              <br>
                              We'd already started working at Augie's. One day Nancy says she's leaving for good, and
                              she started coming to work less and less. So I asked Ms. Anna if anyone else was coming to
                              help me. She said yes, one Belorussian and one Bulgarian. I was like okay. Within a few
                              days, a bunch of dishwashers changed, sometimes all replaced by myself, and suddenly comes
                              Ms. Anna and says:<br>

                              - The Bulgarian girl is here.<br>
                              - Oh, cool.<br>
                              - Only she's gonna work on the front.<br>
                              - Okay, then why you telling me about her?<br>
                              <br>
                              A few hours later, she comes running to me and says guess where she works. And I say,
                              well, obviously here. She says no, what's her other job. I say I don't know. She says
                              Starbucks. I'm like, okay, what can I do now? So we're walking home tired. We see this
                              Slavic-looking girl outside the house. We all said hello, but I wasn't really paying
                              attention. And she went to Starbucks on the boardwalk. We were working at Azbury at the
                              time. We only went to the boardwalk on weekends. But we made a deal with Miss Sandra that
                              we'd be transferred to the boardwalk later. So one day we go to the boardwalk, everybody
                              knows me there. Putting on an apron, I enter the working area and that very moment I saw
                              you, with a pen and a leaf in your hands, it was as if my pupils dilated, the wall broke
                              down and the mind was turned back on full blast. It was like breathing became instantly
                              easier. <br>
                              I'm doing the dishes when you come from behind and ask me: <br>
                              - Are you a Kazakh too? <br>
                              - Yeah, and I guess you're a Bulgarian? <br>
                              - Yeah, how did you know? <br>
                              - Azalia said that Bulgarian girls were coming, so I assumed. <br>
                              Suddenly there was silence, it was like the dialog was over, but I wanted to continue
                              it<br>
                              - And the capital of Bulgaria is Sofia?<br>
                              - Yes, and I also know the capital of Kazakhstan. It's Astana.<br>
                              - Wow, yeah. Cool, not a lot of people know that.<br>
                              - And before it was called Nur-Sultan, and before that it was called Astana again.<br>
                              - It's amazing how you know all that?<br>
                              - We were studying about Kazakhstan and this is what I remembered.<br>

                              That was the end of the dialog and we continued working. I was in the Customer Support
                              position as always. And on July 5, you learned to be at the cash register for the first
                              time, and I saved your first sticker. I remember that day, because I couldn't take my eyes
                              off you. <br>
                              Exactly one day after we started communicating well, I suggested we go to a movie. That
                              day you gave me your phone number, and in my head I was like "wow, I can't even believe I
                              have her phone number". Then we went home, and you told me you like marvel too. I swear
                              that's the first time I've ever heard a girl say that. Being a big marvel fan, that was
                              just something for me. The rest is fairy tale
