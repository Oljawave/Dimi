                           <p>Perhaps, in your eyes, I am not the person you would like your partner to be. Maybe it's
                              because I don't live up to certain standards or expectations. And perhaps this raises
                              doubts about whether I can provide a stable future. These thoughts torment me, and I begin
                              to wonder: what if this has something to do with my personality or physical
                              characteristics?<br>
                              <br>
                              Asian, Muslim, Kazakh - all these labels seem to become an obstacle, forcing me to doubt
                              myself. Maybe I really am not as attractive or confident as I would like. Maybe my fears
                              and insecurities make me too caring and boring in your eyes.<br>
                              <br>
                              But despite all these thoughts, I want to understand and be understood. I strive to become
                              a better person, to be strong and confident enough to create a bright and promising
                              future.

                              gift, and I feel that I know how to see the beauty in people, I know how to love and
                              accept them as they are.<br>

                              others. I don't know how to hold a grudge, and I don't try to change my natural gifts. I
                              find my happiness in love and acceptance, and if my essence is called to be just like
                              that, then there is no way I can escape it

                           <p>Perhaps, indeed, I was simply not born to be loved. My feelings are sincere, pure, but it
                              seems that nothing comes back. You said that you could read any mortal, but maybe you
                              never saw anything beautiful in me. Or you saw something not good. Perhaps someone else
                              was much better than me. And you simply chose him.<br>
                              <br>
                              I realize that you are not obligated to love me, and I do not place that duty on you. But
                              know that my feelings will remain honest and loyal until the end of my days. My love may
                              be inevitable, but it will still be sincere and selfless, as if it was created to simply
                              give.

                           <p>Perhaps the fact that I often talked about my mother created the impression that I could
                              not move beyond her. We communicate a lot, because she is the same as me - she does not
                              know how to be offended, is not rude and simply does not seek to interfere in my life. We
                              have found our unique form of communication, where there is no place for judgment, but
                              instead there is mutual understanding and support. This probably created the idea that I
                              was too connected to my mother.

                           <p>Perhaps I am too predictable or samey for you. Maybe my routine and the ordinariness of
                              everyday life do not add enough mystery and interest to my personality.<br>
                              <br>
                              Perhaps the excitement and passion you are looking for is missing. Maybe I couldn't create
                              the unpredictable and exciting experience you want in your life.<br>
                              <br>
                              Perhaps I focus too much on my personal problems and worries, without leaving enough space
                              for communication and support in your life.<br>
                              <br>
                              Perhaps my attempts to be too caring and take care of you may create a feeling of
                              pressure. Maybe this doesn't meet your expectations for relationships in general.<br>
                              <br>
                              Perhaps I express my feelings and emotions too rarely.<br>
                              <br>
                              Perhaps there was some uncertainty in my actions and words, and this could create turmoil.
                              Maybe I should have been more clear in expressing my feelings and intentions. But I was as
                              open and honest with you as possible. <br>
                              <br>
                              Perhaps my love for you is felt in my every glance, in the small worries and warmth that I
                              feel when I see you happy. It defies logic or time, it simply is, and I am ready to admit
                              it, even if it means understanding and accepting that it may not be reciprocated. Perhaps
                              this is exactly the case, and I am ready to accept this fact by continuing to love you,
                              even if my love remains one-sided....

                              <br>
                              Maybe the timing is just wrong, maybe the time hasn’t come yet and everything is just going as usual
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              Or you just don't care about me
