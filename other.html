                              useless. All I can do is write a website that she might go to. But this doesn't say
                              anything. She told me that I was not a “guy for an option”, she said something in
                              Bulgarian with a happy face, but did not say the translation. She said touchily that she
                              was waiting for me to come to Starbucks. All this burns me from the inside...

                                 special. The world around you seems to dissolve, and you become the focus of the
                                 camera, surrounded by an atmosphere of amazing beauty

                              spins my brain and my life continues in this biorhythm. Yes, I know we were born not for
                              anyone but for ourselves, if we spend time on ourselves. But in truth, a person always
                              needs a person. I found him... I found someone who was really needed, but at that very
                              moment I remained unnecessary... Perhaps this is the meaning of my life, when fate allows
                              you to enjoy something and immediately takes it away... but leaves you with thoughts and
                              understanding of something that I like to eat, but you don't deserve it.

                           <p>Before meeting her, I was a completely different person, only with her arrival in my life
                              did I begin to truly smile. Everyone will say that I went crazy for loving a foreigner,
                              but only she managed to bring me back as a person. Many may say that she was not the one,
                              you simply idealized her because she devoted time to you and you became attached, but
                              no... because I know what I’m talking about. And she also knows and understands. She said
                              that distance was not a barrier, but deep down I understood that she was still afraid. But
                              I didn’t know how to explain to her that distance means nothing when someone means
                              everything. That there is no need to be afraid of distance, because you can love far away,
                              and you can break up close.

                                 I always wanted to go to another Starbucks, not because it was better there, but
                                 because I felt so good in ours, I wanted to create the illusion that I was cooler
                                 there, in order to get out of the habit of ours

                           <p>Or maybe, before we met, she experienced disappointment in people, and no longer wants to
                              experience the same feelings. She may have lost faith that everyone is different. The idea
                              that everyone can be special and unique sometimes seems lost in the hustle and bustle of
                              everyday life. But maybe I'm wrong, and she's just looking for something that can restore
                              her faith in miracles and the beauty in people...
