                              I would like to tell you about probably my most unusual habit. I think it will be
                              interesting. I don't like to initiate conversations and interact with people, but few know
                              that I love talking to homeless people. It all started from my childhood. From my early
                              years, Дядо Сергей worked at our house. At that time, he was around 60 years old, and by
                              nationality, he was Russian. Not surprising, as in our country, more than 130
                              nationalities live together. But I lived in a city with the least number of Kazakhs;
                              mostly Russians, Koreans, Caucasians, Ukrainians, Tatars, Balkans, and many others lived
                              there. I grew up among them, and I'm very glad about it.<br>
                              <br>
                              So, Uncle Sergey lived in a small house on our territory. He was involved in construction,
                              cleaning, and much more. In my childhood, I didn't pay much attention to him. But later,
                              when I was around 8-10 years old, I spent a lot of time with him, asking various
                              questions. By the time I was 11-13 years old, we were like best friends. He shared stories
                              about his life, various anecdotes, and teachings. (Remember when I told you I tried my
                              first cigarette at 13, guess with whom it was - Red Marlboro). Дядо Серьога was a
                              wonderful person. Before losing everything, he was a successful businessman - he had a
                              poultry farm, a family, a new Volga. But then, he lost everything. There are many stories
                              about him. He always talked to me about humanity, time, and much more. What I remember is,
                              "If you can see the beauty, it's because you carry beauty within yourself. Because the
                              world is like a mirror, in which everyone sees their reflection." He was right. Since
                              then, I started seeing only the beautiful in every person. Also, his legendary words:
                              "Appreciate those who make your world brighter. True value is manifested in the ability to
                              support each other, thus creating unique and valuable connections." Uncle Sergey left this
                              world in 2019...<br>
                              <br>
                              After that, on an intuitive level, without any reason, I started engaging in conversations
                              with homeless people. There are very few of them, but they exist. It's very interesting to
                              talk to them. They are not interested in politics, all the chaos that is happening around.
                              And most importantly, they have retained humanity, that humor and wisdom, literacy and
                              feelings, pure thoughts and love without any additives. People who don't judge by
                              appearance, and it doesn't matter who you are, they just had bad luck in life.<br>
                              <br>
                              In Ocean City, I also met one grandmother, in Starbucks on Asbury. She shared her life
                              experience and such. I met her in Wawa, on the beach, etc. Perhaps you've seen her too
                              (always with a bag, thin, white hair). Once, when I was gathering everything possible for
                              that picnic with you, I decided to buy sushi. And guess what, she was passing by, she knew
                              my name, as she often came to Starbucks (Andrew and I helped her as much as we could). So,
                              I waited for my order, and seeing me, she came to talk. I told her about Asia, she about
                              her youth. And as I was picking up my order, she looked at the sushi, said she had never
                              eaten sushi. I decided to leave her one sushi set (that's why I brought only 12 pieces).
                              And I also asked her for advice; she said, "Don't be shy about your feelings, don't try to
                              count the stars, you might miss your moon..." And also, buy her flowers, no matter what
                              kind, she shouted. And I, fool, didn't even ask where to buy them, collected everything
                              and ran to you...<br>
                              <br>
                              All of them wanted to give me valuable advice. They didn't tell me not to become like
                              them; they told me not to become like society. Meeting such people, I always ask myself
                              why God brings me together with people who are important to me, but I am not important to
                              them... And this is not only about the homeless...<br>
                              <br>
                              Using the advice of people who have learned to appreciate, love, express themselves, and
                              see the beauty, I would like to say once again that you are the most beautiful person, a
                              whole galaxy whom i love so much...
